torrent7z v1.1 (5/22/2020)
==========================
-Changed default behaviour to not recursively search for the input file. Earlier if the sub directories contained one of the input files, they'd get added too
-- This behaviour can be re-enabled with the -rs switch
-Cleaned up some aspects of the code and workspace (thanks Sigmaboy)


torrent7z v0.2 (5/8/2020)
=========================
-When no output 7z filename is provided, torrent7z now defaults to stripping the extension of the input file.
  -Added an option (-K) to keep the extension (like with the previous version).

torrent7z v0.1 (5/6/2020)
=========================
-Initial fork of torrent7z. Stripped out external 7z dependency.
-Stripped unnecessary platform dependency on Windows
