=========================
-Initial fork of torrent7z. Stripped out external 7z dependency.
-Stripped unnecessary platform dependency on Windows

torrent7z v0.2 (5/8/2020)
=========================
-When no output 7z filename is provided, torrent7z now defaults to stripping the extension of the input file.
  -Added an option (-K) to keep the extension (like with the previous version).
